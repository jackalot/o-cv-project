Focus: render the inputs when submitting now that we store the state of each input:
+ add a new property to the state of app
{
    submiting: false,
}
+ create a new function called submitInputs {
    + set the state of submiting to be true;
}
*+ create a new file called Printview.js
{
    create a component called PrintView that extends React.component {
        // this will call off smaller components for each section,
        IE: a Practical Experience component and that Practical Experience will
        render Practical Experience
    }
}
+ attatch submitInputs to the submit button
