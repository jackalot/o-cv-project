Focus: Work out which components we need for our individual sections of our CV app:
Sections we need:
* We need a section for general information, like name, email, phone number.
* A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study)
* A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main tasks of your jobs, 
date from and until when you worked for that company)
