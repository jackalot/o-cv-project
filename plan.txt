Focus: render the inputs when submitting now that we store the state of each input:
+ create a new function called submitInputs {
    
}
*+ create a new file called Printview.js
{
    create a component called PrintView that extends React.component {
        // this will call off smaller components for each section,
        IE: a Practical Experience component and that Practical Experience will
        render Practical Experience
    }
}
